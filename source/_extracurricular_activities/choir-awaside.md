AwaSide is an all-comers, un-auditioned choir, for students who love to sing and are keen to develop their vocal abilities. We sing a range of styles and have a lot of fun along the way. Highlights for our choir include: three successful trips to Sydney to compete in the Australian International Music Festival where the choir has gained silver medals and the bronze award in the Cadenza Competition, part of the NZ Big Sing.

**Who can join:** All students

**When:** Rehearsals are held twice a week during breaks.

**Event:** NZ Choral Federation’s ‘The Big Sing Competition’. AwaSide competed at The Big Sing in Palmerston North in 2019 and were then selected to attend the NZCF’s Lower North Island Cadenza, where our school was awarded a Distinction. We also perform at various community and school events throughout the year.

**Cost:** Travel to The Big Sing
